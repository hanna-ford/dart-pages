New types of platforms or new features in existing platforms continue to be developed to meet users’ demands. With an increasingly large amount of unstructured social data on these platforms, social media and networking analysis research aims to develop efficient, reliable, scalable, explainable, reproducible, and theoretically grounded data science approaches to understand our digital behaviors and make it a safer and valuable place. Our talk will focus on collective opinions and their evolution, deviant behavior modeling, automatic annotation of multimedia data, and informing disaster response with social media.</p></div><div><p><strong>Presenter's Bios:</strong></p><p><strong>Nitin Agarwal</strong> is the Jerry L. Maulden-Entergy Endowed Chair and Distinguished Professor of Information Science at University of Arkansas at Little Rock. He is the founding director of the Collaboratorium for Social Media and Online Behavioral Studies (COSMOS) Research Center at UA Little Rock. His research aims to push the boundaries of our understanding of digital and cyber social behaviors that emerge and evolve constantly in the modern information and communication platforms. At COSMOS, he is leading projects with over $20 million funding from an array of U.S. federal agencies including Department of Defense, DARPA, Department of State, National Science Foundation and plays a significant role in the long-term partnership between UA Little Rock and the Department of Homeland Security. These projects range from social computing and (deviant) behavior modeling to smart health to smart cities and infrastructure resiliency leveraging fundamentals of AI, big data mining, machine learning, network science, group dynamics, influence, trust, collective action, and social cyberforensics. He developed publicly available social media mining tools, assisting NATO Strategic Communications and public affairs and other agencies. He has published 10 books and over 200 articles in top-tier peer-reviewed forums with several best paper awards and nominations and delivered over 100 keynotes and invited talks at DARPA, Pentagon, NATO, Department of State, Facebook, Twitter, Singapore ministries, among others.
