Oversees research activities within and across the topic areas ensuring that collaborative activities are ongoing, productive, and fall within the defined research goals of the project.</li><li>All other members submitted on the NSF proposal are listed as Sr. Personnel.</li></ul><h3 id="mcetoc_1elqjodgh31">Research Theme Roles</h3><ul><li><strong>Research Theme CoLead:</strong> A CoLead has two important administrative roles: 1) serve as liaison between SSC and the respective research theme faculty groups; 2) lead the respective research theme in maintaining synchronous progress across all activities within the research theme and integrated research themes, including but not limited to: coordinating meetings and distributing communications among research theme faculty members; communicating progress to the SSC; communicating upcoming or existing personnel vacancies to the SSC. The CoLead role is primarily an administrative role and does not include any additional resources or support.</li><li><strong>Research Theme Activity PI and CoPIs:</strong> Each research them includes several activities. For each activity there is one PI. The PI should communicate with the activity team regularly to ensure the project is performing satisfactorily. The PI should liaison with the research theme CoLead. In cases where multiple CoPIs lead a research theme activity, it is their collective responsibility to perform the duties of research theme activity PI.</li><li><strong>Research Theme Sr. Personnel:</strong> In each research theme activity, a number of faculty within that theme are assigned as senior personnel. They each have particular expertise and skills needed to accomplish the milestones in that activity. Faculty may be senior pesonnel in multiple activities and many also serve as PI or CoPI in other activities.</li><li><strong>Research Theme Liaison:</strong> Liaisons have the task of disseminating information between research themes. Individuals with this role have subject area expertise that is relevant in multiple themes and across multiple activities. While they are not necessarily responsible for milestones in their cross-theme activity, they should: 1) attend meetings and keep up with progress in that activity, and 2) inform their theme of relevant results and possible collaborations.</li></ul><h3 id="mcetoc_1elqjodgh32">Other Project Roles</h3><ul><li><strong>Science Steering Committee (SSC; also known as: Leadership Team):</strong> Comprised of CoLeads from each research theme. Provides oversight for the scientific aspects of the program and is responsible for ensuring research theme milestones and objectives are being met annually. The SSC is also responsible for participating in NSF Site Visits, annual conferences, and communicating progress to the external evaluation board and external evaluator via annual reports and presentations.The SSC works closely with the EAB, PI, and CoPI to provide technical and/or scientific guidance as lead researchers on the project. Each SSC member is responsible for at least one planned activity in Section 4.3 of the proposal, and is responsible for planning, execution, reporting, and dissemination via inter-institutional workshops.</li><li><strong>Management Team:</strong> Comprised of vice-provost level administrators from each campus receiving a subaward. The PI, CoPI, and Management Team are responsible for financial decisions and other administrative duties.</li><li><strong>Science Advisory Committee (SAC; also known as the Arkansas EPSCoR Steering Committee):</strong> Committee is composed of representatives from academia, government, and the private sector. The SAC selects the topical areas for each Track-1 Proposal, designates the fiscal agent/proposing organization as the responsible recipient for the RII Track-1 award, and must provide support for the Track-1 Proposal for NSF acceptance.</li><li><strong>External Advisory Board (EAB):</strong> The EAB will include researchers from peer and aspirant universities or national labs who serve as technical consultants providing recommendations on research progress and strategic and long-term sustainability planning during annual site visits. The EAB will serve a critical role in the seed grant program as well as in mentoring and commercialization efforts.</li><li><strong>Industry Advisory Board (IAB):</strong> The IAB members will serve as an intermediary between academia and industry. The IAB will include representatives from Arkansas industry sectors who will be impacted by DART research. Ex-officio members include the project Co-PI (to communicate scientific results), the project PI (to serve as the liaison to government and policy organizations), and members from related organizations like the Arkansas Center for Data Science and the Arkansas Research Alliance. The IAB will meet annually in conjunction with the Annual All-Hands Meeting, and they will meet quarterly to review results and recommend new areas of research and collaboration based on industry needs. One member of the IAB (rotating annually) will serve as a member of the EAB during site visits.</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1elqnsd6b72">Personnel Changes and Vacancies</h2><ul><li>Personnel replacement should only be considered if a researcher has: 1) left their position; 2) has over-allocated their available research time and will not be able to fulfill their role in the project; or 3) is not performing satisfactorily.</li><li><strong>CoLead Vacancies:</strong> Suggestions for Research Theme CoLead replacements should be submitted via email to Steve Stanley (Project Director) at SStanley@ArkansasEDC.com, Jackson Cothren (Project Science Director) at jcothre@uark.edu; and copying Hanna Ford (DART Science Project Manager) hlford@uark.edu ; please include a short synopsis of their qualifications. The SSC should review all requests for CoLead replacement and make a recommendation to the AEDC Central Office for approval. The AEDC Cental Office will notify the Management Team, SAC, and NSF of the final decision.</li><li><strong>Sr. Personnel Vacancies:</strong> Suggestions for Sr. Personnel replacements should be submitted via email to Steve Stanley (Project Director) at SStanley@ArkansasEDC.com, Jackson Cothren (Project Science Director) at jcothre@uark.edu; and copying Hanna Ford (DART Science Project Manager) hlford@uark.edu; please include a short synopsis of their qualification. Requests for Sr. Personnel replacements will have to be reviewed and approved the AEDC Central Office if they are not a direct replacement (same institution and research theme activities). If the replacement is a direct replacement the DART PI and CoPI can approve this replacement. The AEDC Cental Office will notify the Management Team, SAC, and NSF of the final decision.</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1elqnsd6b73">Project Reporting</h2><div class="card-body text-left"><p class="card-text">All faculty are required to submit data to the project’s reporting website, ER Core (<a href="https://dartreporting.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dartreporting.org</a>).
