Our traditional agriculture and manufacturing companies must analyze tremendous amounts of data to remain competitive and our retail and transportation companies are competing in a new and fast-paced world of information. Our challenge is to provide an environment for university and industry collaboration that will sustain this new economy with cutting-edge research and a well-trained workforce that can innovate and provide competitive advantages to Arkansas industries.</p><p>The vision of DART is to improve research capability and competitiveness in Arkansas by creating an integrated statewide consortium of researchers working to establish synergistic excellence in both data analytics and data science education. The overall goals of DART are to develop the means to increase the speed and efficiency of data curation, techniques to protect privacy and impartial content, methods for harnessing the predictive power of machine learning while increasing the interpretability of the predictions, and data science curricula that are inclusive and better prepare students for a data-centric future.</p><p>DART research will systematically investigate key aspects of the following three barriers and develop novel, integrated solutions to address them:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Big data management:</em></strong> Before data streams and datasets can be used in the many kinds of learning models, they are often manually curated, or at the least, curated for a specific problem. We still rely on hosts of analysts to assess the content and quality of source data, engineer features, define and transform data models, annotate training data, and track data processes and movement.</li><li><strong><em>Security and privacy:</em></strong> Government agencies and private entities collect and integrate large amounts of data, process it in real-time, and deliver products or services based on these data to consumers and constituents. There are increasing worries that both the acquisition and subsequent application of big data analytics are not secure or well-managed. This can create a risk of privacy breaches, enable discrimination, and negatively impact diversity in our society.</li><li><strong><em>Model interpretability:</em></strong> Machine learning models often sacrifice interpretability for predictive power and are difficult to generalize beyond their training and test data. But interpretability and generalizability of trained models is critical in many decision-making systems and/or processes, especially when learning from multi-modal and heterogeneous big data sources. There is a continuing to need to better balance the predictive power of complex machine learning models with the strengths of statistical models to better configure deep learning models to allow humans to see the reasoning behind the predictions.</li></ul><p>The DART Seed Grant Program invites scientists throughout Arkansas to identify emerging or transformative areas of research in alignment with DART scientific focus and support one or more of the DART goals, but does not overlap current DART projects. This identified research should strengthen ties to Arkansas business; enhance our talent pool by expanding and/or leveraging research collaborations; or provide unique educational or training opportunities.</p><p>Proposals <strong><u>must align with</u></strong>, but not overlap, work being conducted in one of the following project components/research themes:</p><ul><li>Cyberinfrastructure (CI)</li><li>Data Life Cycle and Curation (DC)</li><li>Learning and Prediction (LP)</li><li>Social Media and Networks (SM)</li><li>Social Awareness (SA)</li><li>Education Research in Data Science (ED)</li></ul><p>Proposals <strong><u>must include</u></strong>:</p><ul><li>A description of how the proposal is related to the DART project components/research themes.</li><li>Collaboration with existing participants of DART, including a letter of support from a current DART participant is required.</li></ul><p>Â </p><h4 id="mcetoc_1f4iba1j4ik">A.Â  Award Information</h4><p><strong>Anticipated Type of Award:</strong>Â  Standard Grant or Cooperative Agreement</p><p><strong>Estimated Number of Awards:</strong> 20 (4-5 awards per year pending availability of funds)</p><p><strong>Anticipated Funding Amount:</strong> $1,368,000</p><p>$1,368,000 will be awarded over the next 4 years pending availability of funds. Approximately $350,000 will be awarded in each year; total number of funded proposals will depend on availability of funds.</p><h4 id="mcetoc_1f4iba1j4il">B.Â  Eligibility</h4><p><strong>Who may submit proposals? </strong>Proposals may be submitted by Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) within the jurisdiction (State of Arkansas). Two- and four-year IHEs (including community colleges) accredited in, and having a campus located in the State of Arkansas, acting on behalf of their faculty members. Involvement of Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) as leads or partners is encouraged.</p><p><strong>Who may serve as PI? </strong>PIs must hold an appointment in research or teaching positions at State of Arkansas IHEs. Current and previous PIs who are, or have, received DART funding are not eligible to receive seed funding; however, can serve as CoPI on proposals. Submissions from junior and non-tenure track faculty are encouraged.</p><p><strong>Limit on number of proposals per organization: </strong>There are no restrictions or limits.</p><p><strong>Limit on number sf proposals per PI or CoPI:</strong> A PI or a co-PI may participate in only one proposal in response to this solicitation. They may not participate in any role in any other proposal.</p><h4 id="mcetoc_1f4iba1j4im">C.Â  Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions</h4><ol><li><strong>Proposal Pagination Instructions:</strong> Each section should be paginated prior to submission.</li><li><strong>Proposal Font, Spacing, and Margin Requirements:</strong> The proposal should conform to the following requirements:<ol><li>Use one of the following fonts identified below:<ul><li>Arial (not Arial Narrow), Courier New, or Palatino Linotype at a font size of 10 points or larger;</li><li>Times New Roman at a font size of 11 points or larger; or</li><li>Computer Modern family of fonts at a font size of 11 points or larger.</li><li>A font size of less than 10 points may be used for mathematical formulas or equations, figures, tables or diagram captions and when using a Symbol font to insert Greek letters or special characters. Other fonts not specified above, such as Cambria Math, may be used for mathematical formulas, equations, or when inserting Greek letters or special characters. PIs are cautioned, however, that the text must still be readable.</li></ul></li><li>No more than six lines of text within a vertical space of one inch.</li><li>Margins, in all directions, must be at least an inch. No proposer-supplied information may appear in the margins.</li><li>Paper size must be no larger than standard letter paper size (8 1/2 by 11").</li><li>These requirements apply to all uploaded sections of a proposal, including supplementary documentation.</li></ol></li><li><strong></strong><strong>Page Formatting:</strong><ol><li>Proposers are strongly encouraged to use only a standard, single-column format for the text.</li><li>The guidelines specified above establish the minimum font size requirements; however, PIs are advised that readability is of paramount importance and should take precedence in selection of an appropriate font for use in the proposal. Use of a small font size makes it difficult for reviewers to read the proposal; Adherence to font size and line spacing requirements also is necessary to ensure that no proposer will have an unfair advantage, by using smaller font or line spacing to provide more text in the proposal.</li></ol></li></ol><p><strong>Proposal Title:</strong> The title of the proposal must begin with the two-letter abbreviation of the research theme followed by a colon. The rest of the title of the proposal should describe the project in concise, informative language so that a technically literate reader can understand what the project is about.
